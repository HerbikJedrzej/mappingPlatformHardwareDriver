Code for microprocessor controlling HW in mapping robot project.
In this repository should be implementation of distance and battery measurements, engine drivers and encoders, PID controller and AHRS.
All those information collected/setted in runtime should be provided by SPI interface.
All information about configuration in startup should be provided by I2C bus in EEprom memory.
